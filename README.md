# Student Performance Predictor

A beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts whether a student is likely to pass based on their study habits, school type, and other personal factors. Designed using real-world Indian education context.

---

## Dataset

A synthetic dataset of 50 Indian students with the following columns:

- `Gender`: Male or Female  
- `School_Type`: Government or Private  
- `Study_Hours`: Daily average study hours  
- `Attendance_Percentage`: Class attendance in %  
- `Parent_Education`: NoSchool, Primary, HighSchool, Graduate  
- `Urban_or_Rural`: Living area  
- `Passed`: Target column â€” Yes or No

---

## Model Used

- **Logistic Regression** from `scikit-learn`
- Label encoding for categorical columns using `LabelEncoder`
- Trained using 80/20 train-test split

---

## Features

- Accepts real-time user input via terminal
- Predicts whether a student will **pass** or **fail**
- Calculates and prints model **accuracy**
- Saves and displays a **confusion matrix**
- Logs all user inputs and predictions to a `.txt` file
